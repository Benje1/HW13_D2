Poly
1. many-shape
2. java objects can be used in any 'shape' that thier class allows, either through inheratance or implementation
3. objects can have several shapes, one for their own class, one for their inherated class(and so on), one any implementation of an interface
4. as many as it has
5. when you want to treat objects of diffrent classes in a similar way. either different objects that share an abstract or inherated class or objects that have the same interface

Comp
1. when an object is part of something else, when a separet object requires it in set up. A composition object does not 'exist' outside of that context
2. when the separtion of the main and composition objects does not make sense
3. aggregation objects can exisit outside of their main object and are usually passed in the argument of that object
4. instead of creating a constructor for each element within the main class they are thier own class that can be set up with properties and methods, shortening the length of the main class file
5. when using composition the objects it is composed of are also destroyed
6. when usein aggregation the objects it is composed of are not destroyed
